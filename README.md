# Commits Rules

Example
```
fix(blog): Imported posts formatted correctly with new styles
feat(blog): Update styles to reflect new design
feat(blog): Add blog feed to site.
```

### First : The Type

- feat: a new feature, or change to existing feature.
- fix: Fixing a bug or known issue in code.
- test: Adding additional tests for existing features.
- chore: Updating build tools, like webpack, gulp, ascripts, etc.
- docs: Update to documentation like README

### Second : The Scope

Your scope can be as granular as you’d like and will likely change based on the complexity of the project. If you’re just starting off a project, you could omit the scope, but I highly recommend you consider it because it forces you to think very clearly about what you’re changing.


### Third : The Description

You want to summarize your commit with a single line. If you can’t, then you probably want to consider breaking the commit down into smaller pieces to make the work logical and self-contained.
